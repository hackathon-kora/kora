# kora

World's first **Q/A decentralized platform** written over **ethereum blockchain** 


# Key problems solved

 1. Fully decentralized, no central authority to control anything. So **say good bye to censorship** on the grounds of political, religious motives.
 2.  No central server and database required
 3.  First of it's kind, which allocates share of **rewards to the promoters (upvoters/ downvoters)** of a question and answer, along with original author.

## Files

 1. **coin.sol** - Smart contract for running kora community and distributing rewards to the users who added value to the platform

## Technology used

 1.  **Ethereum Blockchain**  - We are utilizing consensus algorithms and security features of ethereum blockchain to securely store and transfer our own digital currency **moti**. It stores smart contract for our currency.
2. **EVM** - ethereum virtual machine to validate the results of function call used in our project. It executes the functions of our smart contract.
3. **IPFS**(Inter planetary file system) - IPFS provides us a decentralized, peer to peer and secure way to store information like questions and answers which could not be efficiently stored in the blockchain itself.
4. **Meta-mask**- A browser add-on which helps us to connect to ethereum blockchain using our browser. 
5. **Web3js** - A Java Script library which connects us to our smart contract written on ethereum blockchain using RPC(Remote procedure call).

## Impact

 incentivizes people to provide value to the community, which in turn reduces knowledge gap present in the society.
